## Overview 
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

 Alosm,users can click on the naviation bar to re-initalize the page or allowing quickly back to the home page.

* Filtering by single or multiple parameters
Scrolling down to the index page, user can use the Filter Search by entering the desired date, city,state,country or shape. Once single or mutiple filters entered, the change is dectected and the table is updated.

## Summary:

I thik our website looks nice clean and simple. And our Filter Search can do it's job. However the Filter Search is not very user friendly.

The drawback of filters requires exact key words to perform the search function, which means if user don't have some sort of data as a reference, they can't pull out the desired data. 

The improvment could be create in each searching cell create a drop down menu as choices for user to pick out the available parameters.

The second improvement is creating a reset button in the end so we can clear out the Filter search area.
